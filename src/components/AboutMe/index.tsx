          My name is Kelvin Leandro. I am Brazilian and currently a student of
          Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Cear√°. During my
          academic life, I participated in projects such as the junior
          enterprise of my course called GTi Engenharia Jr., a web development
          company focused on the development and consulting of websites. I am
          currently a scientific initiation scholarship holder, working on
          research involving machine learning and pattern recognition by
          applying different methods for detecting anomalies in EEG data for a
          future &quot;intelligent system for remote patient monitoring&quot;, a
          larger project in which my research is embedded.
